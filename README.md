# Enhance the experience
## FPS
We make the light calculation in the client side, cuz LevelChunkPacket in Bedrock Edition doesn't have the light data.  
To improve the performance, we advise you install the [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight/) mod.

## Skin
Bedrock Edition skins are sent from the server, but Java Edition only supports the skin from mojang API.  
To display the skin, we advise you install [Geyser SkinUtility](https://github.com/Camotoy/BedrockSkinUtility) mod.
